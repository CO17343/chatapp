Project Description:

The project is a web application that provides a user authentication feature. It utilizes a front-end built with React for the user interface and a back-end server powered by Node.js and Express. The authentication functionality involves collecting a user's desired username through a form and sending it to a server endpoint.

Key Components and Features:

Front-End (React):

The front-end consists of a single React functional component named AuthPage.
It renders a form prompting the user to set a username.
The form includes an input field for the username and a submit button.
The form submission triggers an HTTP POST request to the server.
Back-End (Node.js and Express):

The back-end is an Express.js server listening on port 3001.
It exposes an endpoint for user authentication at /authenticate.
Upon receiving a POST request to /authenticate, the server uses Axios to send a PUT request to an external API (ChatEngine) with the provided username.
The server handles successful responses by extracting relevant data and responding to the client.
Errors during the authentication process are caught and logged.
External API (ChatEngine):

The project interacts with the ChatEngine API to handle user authentication.
The authentication involves making a PUT request to the ChatEngine API with the provided username.
Additional Notes:

The front-end and back-end communicate through HTTP requests using Axios.
The project uses CORS middleware to handle cross-origin resource sharing.
There might be an issue with an invalid code block (props.onAuth({ username: value, secret: value });) that seems to be outside the onSubmit function.
